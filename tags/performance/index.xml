especially those built with React. While it shines on macOS and Linux,
Windows users can sometimes encounter significant slowdowns. This post
details how to identify performance bottlenecks in Jest tests on Windows
and shares techniques to achieve lightning-fast feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem-slow-tests-on-windows"&gt;The Problem: Slow Tests on Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You recently joined a React project and were met with a six-minute wait for
Jest test results â€“ unacceptable for a smooth development workflow. The
project, primarily developed on macOS, had only 300 test suites and around
1,000 individual tests. Investigating further revealed this slowness is a
known issue for Jest on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
