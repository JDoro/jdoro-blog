I wanted to share a fun game that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing in the past called
&lt;a href="https://warrior.js.org/"&gt;WarriorJS&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve shared this with many friends and
clients over the last few years and it&amp;rsquo;s always been a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is a fun way to learn JavaScript and programming concepts in a
gamified environment. You play as a warrior climbing a tower, battling enemies,
and collecting treasure. The twist? You write JavaScript code to control your
warrior&amp;rsquo;s actions. The core mechanic is that you must write the logic for one
&amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; at a time. You must sense your surroundings and make decisions based
on the information available to you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
