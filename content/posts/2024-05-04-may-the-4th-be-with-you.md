This is one of my favorite days of the year! I've been a massive Star Wars fan 
my entire life. I remember watching the original trilogy with my mom when I was
a kid, and I've been hooked ever since. 

**I even have a tattoo of the Rebel Alliance symbol on my arm!**

The stories and characters are near and dear to my heart and I constantly bring
them into my daily life and software development. 

As I'm re-watching the original trilogy with my dog today to mark the occasion,
I thought I'd share the [Star Wars Api (swapi)](https://swapi.dev/) with you all.
It's a wonderful little free api that you can use for practice applications. 

May the 4th be with you all! ðŸŒŒðŸš€
