Today's post is a bit different from my usual content on best practices and tips. 
I wanted to share a fun game that I've been playing in the past called 
[WarriorJS](https://warrior.js.org/). I've shared this with many friends and 
clients over the last few years and it's always been a hit. 

This game is a fun way to learn JavaScript and programming concepts in a
gamified environment. You play as a warrior climbing a tower, battling enemies,
and collecting treasure. The twist? You write JavaScript code to control your
warrior's actions. The core mechanic is that you must write the logic for one
"turn" at a time. You must sense your surroundings and make decisions based 
on the information available to you. 

You can either run the game in your terminal or play it in the browser. 

The game is a great way to practice problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and
JavaScript skills. It's beginner-friendly, but also offers challenges for more
experienced developers. The levels gradually introduce new concepts and
challenges, making it a great learning tool. It even includes some fairly good 
[documentation](https://warrior.js.org/docs/en/player/overview) to help you 
along the way.

If you're looking for a fun logic puzzle to challenge yourself and maybe learn 
a little javascript along the way, I highly recommend giving WarriorJS a try.
