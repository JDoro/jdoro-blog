This will be a blog to post some of my ideas and feelings on the software.

## Introduction to me
Howdy!

I'm a software engineer/architect who has been working in the industry for
over 10 years, gaining experience in various technologies and domains. I 
have a passion for craftsmanship and learning, and I'm always looking for
new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. 

I have a strong interest in UI development and I've worked with a variety 
of libraries and frameworks in this space. My favorite being Reactjs. I 
also have a ton of experience with backend web application development 
with java and Spring Boot.

Over the last decade I've
worked on a variety of projects, from small web applications to large-scale
enterprise systems, and I've learned a lot along the way. I'm excited to
share some of my thoughts and experiences here, and I hope you find them
interesting and useful.
